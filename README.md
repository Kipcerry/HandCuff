This script adds a complete handcuff and restraint system designed for realistic roleplay interactions.

Players can restrain others using handcuffs or tiewraps, drag restrained players, and place or remove them from vehicles. Each pair of handcuffs generates unique handcuff keys when used. These keys only work for the specific handcuffs they were created for, adding an extra layer of realism and security.

Handcuffs can be removed using the correct keys or, if enabled, by lockpicking. Tiewraps require scissors to be cut. When handcuff keys are used, the original handcuffs are returned to the player.

The script includes optional police-only restrictions and seamless integration with ox_inventory, with item images included.
